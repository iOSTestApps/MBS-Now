New in version 3, there's the ability to view and create meetings for clubs. Everything can be done entirely through the app.

A few tips...
* Be sure your club is registered. Visit gdyer.de/clubs.html to begin.

* After creating a meeting, you'll be given the option to enable future editing. If you do not save the editing URL, you will have to contact Graham Dyer to modify or remove your meeting.

* You can easily flag a meeting for removal or editing by (1) tapping the output button on a meeting's details page, (2) selecting 'Flag for review', and (3) providing the requested information.

* Please report any fake, inappropriate, or accidentally created meetings through the same method alluded to above.

Please report bugs with clubs through 'Bug Reporter' on the 'Home' tab. Do *not* report invalid meetings through the bug reporter.
