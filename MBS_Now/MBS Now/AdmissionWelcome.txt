We know that the process of selecting the right school can be daunting, but it can also be illuminating and exciting, for it gives you and your child the opportunity to reflect deeply on the kind of school experience you would like to have.  At the end of your admission process, you will have a new understanding and appreciation of your child, his or her interests and talents.  A thoughtful admission process is well worth your while.
