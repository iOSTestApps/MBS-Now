THINGS THAT NEED TO BE UPDATED IN A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME

	Every new school year (all of these require an app update)
		In Offline VC
			- A/B week list THIS ALSO MUST CHANGE IN FORMS VC and on http://fo.gdyer.de/formTitles.txt and gdyer.de/forms (actual PDF)
			- Possibly the actual offline schedules if there are any changes (Mr. Burns will tell you if so)
		In Welcomes VC
			- If there is a new headmaster or director of admissions, image and text must change
		In About VC
			- If there is a new headmaster, the text must change
		In Contact VC
			- If there is a new attendance, nurse, or head of upper or middle school person, this VC must be updated.
		In Forms VC
			- AP and SAT/ACT forms must be updated. Google dates for each exam, get/generate PDF for each.
		In notifications (SettingsVC)
			- You need to add A/B weeks, special (general) notifications, and dress-up days.
				Be SURE to confirm EVERYTHING, even during the school-year, with Mrs. Elliot

	Every month (these changes are all through FTP)
		In LunchVC
			- iPad lunch menu (Lunch.pdf) Download new menus from: http://www.myschooldining.com/mbs/
					NOTE: this will likely need to be changed more frequently, as the cafeteria lady (blondish hair, glasses)
							often does not write up the entire month at a time. Therefore, change
							this form to ensure that at least the next two days are there.

	Every week (these changes are all through FTP)
		In LunchVC
			- iPhone/iPod touch lunch menus (Monday.pdf, Tuesday.pdf, ... Sunday.pdf)
				Download new menus from: http://www.myschooldining.com/mbs/

	EACH VERSION
		1. update screenshots in HomeVC
		2. update version number text file on fo.gdyer.de/version.txt
		3. update version number in info.txt and PCH (pre-compiled headers)
		4. update version number in Whatâ€™s New (info VC and home VC) and initializer
		5. update version number in AppDelegate
