The Club's main goal is to promote an appreciation for the visual arts both within the club and throughout the entire school community. Members are not required to be enrolled in an art class or even to possess artistic experience or ability. The club allows all students to give the visual arts a try, without committing to a particular class. It focuses on creative, group projects, such as creating murals in classrooms on campus.

Originally intended to serve as a workshop forum for songwriting, composing, arranging and, finally, recording original music collaboratively, the club quickly became an activity where student musicians, composers and singers perform twice a year in a concert atmosphere. CMW also creates opportunities for students to shine in the essential areas of lighting, sound design and promotion.</string>

	<key>FilmClub</key>
	<string>Not just for showing movies, Film Club is a forum to discuss the deeper meaning behind tasteful films that show a director or actor's true mastery of the art. We do not define ourselves by a particular genre or decade, rather, we chose to span the entire gamut, focusing more on the last 30-40 years of film. With an average of one or two films being shown after school every month, with free admission and food frequently provided for a small fee, any student can enjoy a classic film after their sports practice.</string>

	<key>ForeverFriends</key>
	<string>Forever Friends is a program to help patients with cancer. It was started in honor of a young girl named Mia who died of cancer. Forever Friends is a non-profit organization dedicated to help cancer patients cope with their illness. Some of the money raised is donated to cancer research but majority of the funds raised goes to buying teddy bears to donate to hospitals. We do regular bear drop offs where we give boxes of teddy bears to the cancer wing of the hospitals and sometimes we are allowed to hand them out to the patients directly. Just seeing how happy it makes them is surprising, some patients even cry of happiness when they receive the bear! To the patients, the bears symbolize hope and show that people really care and want them to get better. Over the summer, we organized a fashion show to raise money. The fashion show is a huge event and always brings significant money for the organization. If you would like to know more about the organization, visit us at www.foreverfriendsgive.org.</string>

Currently, the club is working on re-vamping the school's recycling to make it more effective and worth while. Last year, Morristown-Beard participated in the Green Cup Challenge; along with other schools from across the country. Though we did not place highly in the winning category, the challenge helped to spread awareness about the importance of conserving energy, as well as the economical benefits of doing so! McMormick, who is the club's advisor, and I, the club's President are hoping to make the Green Cup Challenge an exciting tradition for years to follow! In addition, we hope to gather new members to help out with recycling!</string>

	<key>ListentotheTrees</key>
	<string>The purpose of listen to the trees is to give students a distraction from their busy weeks and the stress that they are constantly feeing, with an element of community service. Each meeting we conduct a craft. Some of our most popular activities include making dream catchers, hemp jewelry, or candle holders. We plan on selling every craft and donating all the proceeds to an underprivileged village in India. One of the club leaders visited and worked with a village of Tibetans as a freshmen and we continue to support their growth and development. The club also plays a major role in Morristown-Beard's annual music concert, Beardstock. We will set up booths to sell our crafts as well as to host various activities including henna tattoos.</string>
	<key>Mariah</key>
	<string>The Mariah is the upper school literary magazine comprising of 10-12 students and 2 teacher advisors.

Many of our members discuss how some of these problems could be fixed and provide ideas on how MBS can do our part. The club has had guest speakers, one of which was a Scuba Instructor from Milburn. The Club has also been trying to organize a beach clean up and other activities to benefit our oceans. The primary goal of this club is to spread the awareness of the declining health of the oceans around the world.

	<string>Every Monday afternoon the Matheny Volunteer Program, currently under the direction of Mr. Lamson and Mrs. Chipana, participates in recreational, art, music and dance therapy with the residents at the Matheny Medical and Educational Center in Peapack-Gladstone. Although only seven Upper and Middle School volunteers may participate at each trip, a pool of 75 volunteers is maintained. All Matheny activities have a common thread of Morristown-Beard School volunteers genuinely wanting to help others by trying to get the residents to smile or laugh, and to add an hour of brightness and love to the lives of handicapped adolescents. In many instances the Matheny residents come to the main front door in anticipation of the arrival of the friendly faces from Morristown-Beard.</string>
	<key>MediaandStagecraftClub</key>
	<string>The formation of the Media and Stagecraft Club is partially a response to the fact that colleges, with increasing frequency, are offering courses of study for digital media creation, whether its for Film, Audio, Graphics, or Animation. In addition the volume and frequency with which students at MBS are generating digital content to be shown in venues like Morning Meeting, CMW, Coffeehouse performances, and an ongoing list of events, the club creates a formal opportunity for students to organize and work together and learn about new media and how to create it. All things "technical," both in Founders Hall and in Wilkie Hall, are fodder for the club and its participants. Lights, Sound, filming, special effects, set building, stage and theater management, etc., will find support and a launching pad from within the Media and Stagecraft Club.</string>
	<key>ModelUN</key>
	<string>The Model United Nations Club at Morristown Beard is an organization dedicated towards the better understanding of contemporary international issues as well as the United Nations. The club is presided over by the guiding principle of cooperation in an increasingly uncooperative international community. It is therefore our goal to further the spirit of compassion, cooperation, and community while simultaneously applying methods of critical thinking in order to resolve international conflicts. The club acts as a safe environment for those committed to the effort to create a more peaceful world for all. The club participates in, on average, two conferences coordinated by the respected organization, IDIA. This past winter a group of 14 boys and girls participated in the Philadelphia Model United Nations conference where two students received "Outstanding Delegate" awards, illustrating the hard work and commitment of the club members.

We have participated in creating breakfast-bags-to-go, handing out flyers to promote the Hunger Walk, and organizing the food pantry. Volunteering at the soup kitchen provides the opportunity for the group to give back to the community and meet other students.</string>

	<string>The Salmagundi staff starts their yearbook magic long before the school year starts, so long before the previous year isn't even concluded! The Salmagundi staff look to seek out interested students and recruit them to work on the different sections of the yearbook, which includes layout, design, and photography. The supplement, which includes all the spring activities is completed during the early part of July so we also have staff working during part of the summer. Some highlights of our group are choosing the cover of the yearbook, listening to music, creating new and innovative layouts, and bonding as a group.

	<string>A new club at MBS this year, the Stained Glass Club's goals are to give an opportunity for students to learn how to design and make stained glass art pieces. The club meets on Tuesdays after school and it is essentially a studio session in which the students not only do their own work but assist others in learning stained glass techniques. For this first year, there are no major events on our calendar, but an end of the school year exhibition of student work will be the goal for next year!</string>

We ask students, parents, faculty, staff, and others outside of the school to come and donate blood. One out of every three people will need blood during their lifetime and every donation helps. On average we have 22 student captains consisting of juniors and seniors and 2 or 3 coordinators of both seniors and juniors. We work with New Jersey Blood Services to collect whole blood and red cells and ask for student volunteers who cannot donate to provide the drive with baked goods. The drives are organized by Laurie Hartman, who also teaches art classes in the school.</string>

The speech team and debate team each meet once a week to practice and prepare for competition. Speech competitors focus on stylistic components such as tone, body language, and eye contact. Debators meet to research and construct arguments on that month's topic. Competitions are typically once a month on a Saturday. Forensics encourages students to push their intellectual boundaries, improve their public speaking skills, and increase their confidence (while also having some fun). Crushing the competition is a reward well worth the work.
